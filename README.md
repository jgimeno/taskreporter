## TaskReporter (DDD)

### Objective of this project

In my job my boss requieres that every day when we finish we send an Email
to him and to our manager with a list of tasks we did that day. 

It was really boring at the end of the journey to open my email client and remember all that I
did. So it was a nice excuse to create a tiny command line app in PHP following a
**Domain Driven Design** approach.

I started with a code first approach so if you see 
no framework at all it's because I still did not decide if I will need one!

Don't you think is a good idea to start developing since the beginning and
 not being coupled to any framework? :D
